        question: 'What exactly am I investing in?',

      {
        question: 'What returns can I expect?',
        answer: 'Historical average is approximately 20% per project over 12-18 months. Individual projects have ranged from 15% to 52% depending on the specific opportunity. Past performance does not guarantee future results.',

        question: 'How long is my money locked?',
