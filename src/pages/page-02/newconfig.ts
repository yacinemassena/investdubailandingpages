    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Will I actually own something with just 5,000 AED?',
        answer: 'Yes. You own equity shares in the SPV holding the property. While your slice is proportional to your investment, your legal rights are absolute. You have the exact same standing, protection, and profit priority as an investor putting in 200,000 AED.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I withdraw my money early?',
        answer: 'Your capital is deployed into a physical asset, so it\'s committed until the sale (typically 6-18 months). The trade-off for this lack of liquidity is that your money is actively working—building value through renovation.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Are there any fees?',
        answer: 'No entry or management fees. We take 40% of profits only when the project is profitable. Your entire 5,000 AED goes toward the property. If the project doesn\'t make money, we don\'t get paid.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I build a portfolio over time?',
        answer: 'Consistency is key. Imagine investing 5,000 AED in 3 different projects over a year. If each returns ~20%, you\'re compounding gains on multiple fronts. Reinvesting those profits creates a snowball effect.',
