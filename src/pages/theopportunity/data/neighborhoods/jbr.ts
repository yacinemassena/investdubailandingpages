## Conclusion

JBR delivers attractive rental yields driven by beach access and lifestyle appeal. The combination of direct beach, The Walk amenities, and tourist demand creates consistent rental interest.

However, for investors seeking maximum returns, the flip strategy significantly outperforms rental income. The optimal approach may combine both: flip to build capital, then transition to rental for passive income.`,
