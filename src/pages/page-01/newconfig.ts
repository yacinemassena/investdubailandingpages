Third, our parent company Greenbull Group is valued at €230M with 1,200+ shareholders. We've been operating since 2020 with 50+ successful exits.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I really invest remotely from anywhere?',
        answer: "100% yes. Our entire process is digital: online signup, digital KYC, electronic fund transfers, and real-time progress tracking. Most of our 2,500+ investors have never set foot in Dubai.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the minimum investment?",
        answer: "You can start from just 5,000 AED (~€1,000). This low entry point lets you test the model with limited risk, diversify across multiple projects, and build exposure progressively.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What if the Dubai market crashes?',
        answer: "Our model is designed to withstand downturns. We buy properties 30–40% below renovated market value, then add $2–4M in tangible renovation value. Even if the market drops 20–30%, our built-in margin protects capital.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How long is my money locked up?',
        answer: "Typical flip duration is 6–18 months from investment to profit distribution. There's no secondary market currently, so you should be comfortable with this timeline.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if renovation costs more than planned?',
        answer: "We guarantee fixed renovation costs upfront. If there are overruns, we absorb them 100% — your invested capital is never exposed to budget surprises.",
