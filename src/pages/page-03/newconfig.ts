    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Is flipping riskier than buy-to-let?',
        answer: 'They carry different risks. Flipping has market timing risk but much shorter exposure (6-18 months). Buy-to-let has tenant risk, vacancy risk, and long-term market exposure. Our flipping model mitigates risk through deep value-add margins and a no-debt structure.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What returns are realistic?',
        answer: 'Flipping: 15-25% per project over 6-18 months. Buy-to-let: 4-6% annual yield plus potential appreciation over many years. On a per-year basis, flipping typically delivers significantly more.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I do both?',
        answer: 'Absolutely. Many investors use flipping for active capital growth and buy-to-let for long-term passive income. Different goals, different strategies—and they complement each other well.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Which is more hands-off?',
        answer: 'Our flipping model is completely hands-off—we manage sourcing, renovation, and sale end-to-end. Buy-to-let requires ongoing management even with a property manager handling day-to-day operations.',
