- Furnishing: AED 150,000
- Total: AED 5,650,000

**Annual Returns:**
- Gross rent: AED 290,000

### 5-Year Flip Scenario

**Per Flip:**

- Profit: AED 1,017,000

**5 Years:**
- Average cycle: 5 months

- **Total return: ~AED 12,200,000 (216%)**

The flip strategy delivers approximately 5x the returns.

## Short-Term Rental Potential

### Considerations
- Family community (less tourist appeal)
- Longer-term rentals more suitable

- Lower yields than tourist areas

### Recommendation
Focus on long-term family rentals for Dubai Hills Estate. The community's family orientation makes it better suited for stable, longer tenancies than short-term holiday rentals.

## Conclusion

Dubai Hills Estate delivers competitive rental yields driven by strong family demand. The combination of quality schools, excellent amenities, and safe environment creates consistent tenant interest.

However, for investors seeking maximum returns, the flip strategy significantly outperforms rental income. The optimal approach may combine both: flip to build capital, then transition to rental for passive income.`,
