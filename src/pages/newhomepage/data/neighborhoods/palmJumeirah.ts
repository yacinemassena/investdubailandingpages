- Dehumidification costs
- Material selection for renovations

## Cost Management Strategies

### For Rental Investors

- Budget conservatively for maintenance
- Build reserve fund (6 months expenses)
- Regular preventive maintenance
- Quality materials reduce long-term costs

### For Flip Investors

- Minimize holding period
- Budget accurately for holding costs
- Factor all costs into acquisition pricing
- Quality renovation reduces buyer concerns

## Comparing to Other Areas

| Emirates Hills | 8-15 |
| Downtown Dubai | 15-35 |
