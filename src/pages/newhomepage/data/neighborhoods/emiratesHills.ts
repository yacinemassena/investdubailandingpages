- Insurance: AED 50,000
- Net rent: AED 1,100,000
- Net yield: 2.2%

### Why Yields Are Lower

Emirates Hills yields are lower than other areas because:
1. Premium purchase prices
2. Limited rental demand (small tenant pool)
3. Long vacancy periods possible
4. High maintenance costs

However, absolute rental income is substantial.

### 5-Year Flip Scenario

**Per Flip:**

**5 Years:**
- Average cycle: 18 months
- 3.3 flips possible
- Cumulative profit: ~AED 46,500,000
- **Total return: ~AED 46,500,000 (99%)**

The flip strategy delivers approximately 3x the returns.

## When Rental Makes Sense

### Suitable Situations
- Long-term wealth preservation
- Passive income priority
- Unable to manage flip execution
- Diversification from flip portfolio
- Tax or estate planning reasons

### Rental Advantages
- Predictable income
- Lower management intensity
- No renovation risk
- Stable asset holding

## Conclusion

Emirates Hills' rental market serves an ultra-premium tenant demographic with substantial absolute income potential. However, percentage yields are lower than other areas due to premium pricing.

For investors seeking maximum returns, the flip strategy significantly outperforms rental income. The optimal approach may be using flip profits to eventually build a rental portfolio for passive income in later years.`,
