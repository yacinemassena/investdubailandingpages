Page 7: Returns & Profit Sharing

Headline: You Get 60% of Every Dollar of Profit. We Only Win When You Win.

Answer Capsule:
Returns come from value creation through renovation—the difference between purchase + renovation costs and the final sale price. Profits are split 60/40: 60% to you, 40% to us. But here's the kicker: you also receive a 15% priority return before any profit sharing begins. The first 15% goes entirely to you. Only after you've earned 15% do we start splitting. No entry fees, no management fees, no hidden costs. True alignment.

Profit Waterfall:

1. Built-In Margin — Off-market acquisition at 30–40% below renovated market value.
2. Manufactured Profit — Renovation adds $2–4M in market value.
3. Premium Capture — Renovated villas command top-of-market prices.
4. Full Transparency — You see every cost deducted from sale proceeds.
5. 60% Upside — 60% of net profit goes to investors proportionally.
6. 15% Priority Return First — Investors receive 15% priority return before any profit split kicks in.
