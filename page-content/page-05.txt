Headline: 9,800 Millionaires Moved to Dubai Last Year. Guess What They're Buying?

Answer Capsule:
You're investing in a market with a fundamental supply-demand imbalance that won't resolve anytime soon. 9,800+ millionaires relocated to Dubai in 2024 alone—more than any other city globally. They all need homes. But here's the problem: only 20% of new construction is villas, and prime locations like Palm Jumeirah are out of land. These wealthy buyers don't want construction projects—they want move-in-ready luxury now. That's the gap we exploit.

Market Drivers:

1. World's Richest Migration Wave — Dubai is now the #1 destination for millionaire migration globally—9,800+ in 2024 alone.

2. Scarce Asset Class — Only 20% of new Dubai development is villas. In prime areas like Palm Jumeirah, land is essentially gone.

3. Renovation Value Gap — Many prime villas were built before 2015. New buyers want modern finishes.

4. Global Price Arbitrage — Dubai luxury is still 2–5x cheaper per sqm than Monaco, Hong Kong, or NYC.

5. Tax Migration — 0% income tax, 0% capital gains tax.

6. Proven Demand — Our buyer network spans France, the UK, China, India, Germany, and beyond. We've never struggled to find qualified purchasers.
