Badge: Flipping vs. Buy-to-Let

Headline: Stop Settling for 5% Rental Yields. Target 20% Returns in 12 Months.

Answer Capsule:
You've been told buy-to-let is the 'safe' path to Dubai real estate wealth. But here's what they don't mention: 4-6% annual yields, capital locked for years, tenant headaches, vacancy risk, and endless property management calls. Villa flipping offers a fundamentally different equation: 20% target returns in 6-18 months, zero tenants, zero management, and your capital back fast for reinvestment.

Comparison:

| Aspect | Flipping | Buy-to-Let |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Capital Return | 6-18 months | 5-10+ years locked |
| Returns | 15-25% per project | 4-6% annual yield |
| Profit Source | Manufactured via renovation | Market speculation |
| Management | Completely hands-off | Always on call |
| Tenants | Zero | Constant headache |

Trust Section:

- Higher Returns Per Year: A 20% target in 12 months significantly outperforms 4–6% annual rental yield—even accounting for compounding.

- Faster Capital Recycling: Get your money back in 6–18 months instead of years locked in buy-to-let.

- Zero Tenant Risk: No vacancies, no late payments, no property damage, no tenant disputes.
