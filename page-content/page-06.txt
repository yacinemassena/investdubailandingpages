Badge: 6–18 Month Cycles

Headline: Your Money Works for 6–18 Months. Then You Get It Back—With Profit.

Answer Capsule:
You're not locking your money away for a decade. A typical flip cycle runs 6–18 months from investment to profit distribution. Unlike buy-to-let where your capital sits frozen for 5-10 years, our short cycles mean faster returns and quicker reinvestment.
