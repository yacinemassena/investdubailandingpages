Hero:
- Eyebrow: Regulated Real Estate Crowdfunding
- Headline: The most logical investment in real estate
- Subheadline: Buy undervalued luxury villas in Dubai, renovate them, sell at market price. The gap between non-renovated and renovated is your return — and it's been there for years.
- Stats: 50+ villas flipped | 29% average historical payout | 6-18 mo typical cycle | 0% debt used

The Opportunity:
Non-renovated villas sell for 50% less than renovated ones. In Dubai, villas in the same community with the same layout have consistent pricing. Non-renovated properties trade at 35-60% less than renovated ones. We buy non-renovated villas, renovate them, and sell at the renovated market price. The price difference is your profit.

"We create value through redevelopment — not by betting on market growth."

Project Results:
$130M+ In Profits Distributed. 40 villas acquired, with over $130M in profits distributed already achieved and an average return of 74.17% on completed projects.

Why The Gap Exists:
- Standardized villa typologies — Dubai developers use identical floor plans within each community
- Prime locations with aging stock — Palm Jumeirah, Jumeirah Islands, and Al Barari villas are 10-20 years old
- Measurable renovation value — We can calculate exactly how much value a full renovation adds

Investment Structure:
- 15% Priority return for investors (paid first)
- ~20% Target return per project
- 29% Average historical payout
- €1,000 Minimum investment

How It Works:
1. Create Account — Sign up online and complete KYC. Takes under 5 minutes.
2. Choose a Project — Browse available villa projects with full details.
3. Invest — Fund your wallet and invest from €1,000. A dedicated SPV is created.
4. Watch It Happen — Track the renovation with weekly updates.
5. Get Paid — When the villa sells, your capital + profits are credited.

What Makes Invest Dubai Different:
- We do the work ourselves — In-house architects, daily on-site supervision, 50+ luxury villas completed
- You own the asset — Each project sits in a dedicated SPV. You hold shares, the SPV holds the title deed.
- Zero debt, zero leverage — 100% cash acquisitions. No bank loans, naturally Sharia-compliant.
- Fixed-cost renovation guarantee — Renovation budgets are locked upfront. If we overspend, we absorb the cost.
- Full transparency — Weekly Instagram story updates, YouTube documentation, visible properties.
- Regulated structure — Invest Dubai operates through a regulated crowdfunding partner under UAE law.

Aligned Incentives:
We only profit when you profit. The team profits only when the villa sells at a gain — same as you. There's no management fee on your capital.
